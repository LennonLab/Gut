## Read in file in .csv format with columns day, abundance(10^7), and complexity


```{r}
abundance <- read.table("./data/20190218_0544_PilotAbundance.csv", header = TRUE, sep =",")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
plot(Abundance ~ Day + Complexity, abundance, type = "b", main = "Cell abundance from plating", col = abundance$Complexity, pch = 16, ylab = "Abundance ( *10^7 cells/mL)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
