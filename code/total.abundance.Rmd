```{r}
rm(list = ls())
require(ggplot2)
```

## Read in file in .csv format with columns day, abundance(10^7), and complexity


```{r}
#abundance <- read.table("../data/20190218_0544_PilotAbundance.csv", header = TRUE, sep =",")
abundance <- read.table("../data/20190219_0904_PilotAbundance.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
ggplot(abundance, aes(y = Abundance, x = Day, color = Complexity)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + ggtitle("Cell abundance from flow cytometry")+ ylab("Abundance(*10^8 cells/mL)")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
